Paintings in oil and tempera, drawings in chalk and charcoal. Individual and group portraits. Corporate, academic, families and children. Sittings in Yorkshire and London.</p><h2>Biography</h2><p>Bing Jones paints and draws portraits from live sittings.</p><p>He has a purpose built studio in Sheffield, with controlled natural light. He also arranges sittings in London and will travel elsewhere by arrangement.</p><p>He feels the sittings are essential to achieve a satisfying traditional result.</p><p>He has undertaken academic, professional and corporate commissions for 30 years and has drawn and painted hundreds of children and dozens of family groups.</p><p>He works from live sittings using traditional methods.</p><p>He was trained in medicine at the University of Bristol and in painting at Sheffield School of Art and Design. He has combined careers in portrait painting and medicine all his working life.</p><p>He lives with his wife who is both an artist and lecturer in the History of Art.

Traditional portraits in oil and tempera on canvas use proven centuries-old methods. These paintings enrich both families and institutions, and will probably outlive artist and sitter.</p><h2>Drawings</h2><p>Traditional drawings in charcoal or chalk, with coloured pastel shades, catch expression and likeness in a fresh and lively manner. These can be made quickly or in more detail. They are often commissioned as presents, for birthdays, weddings or retirement.</p><h2>Pricing of commissioned portraits</h2><p>Prices vary with size, content and the number of sittings.</p><article class="sub-section"><h3>Every commission is different</h3><p>Each begins with a discussion of what you might like.</p><p>Please don't hesitate to contact the artist by phone or email.</p></article><article class="sub-section"><h3>Sittings are in Sheffield or London</h3><p>The artist will be happy to discuss other venues.</p><p>They are generally for about an hour, with regular breaks.</p></article><article class="sub-section"><h3>Pricing illustration</h3><p>Charcoal drawings from &pound;250 single sitting.</p><p>Coloured chalk drawings from &pound;500, usually two sittings.</p><p>Larger and more finished drawings from &pound;1000, two or more sittings.</p><p>Oil Portraits from &pound;2500 for a head and shoulders.

Everyone is delighted with it and many complimentary comments have been made.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="quote">Just a note to say how absolutely delighted I am with the portrait. It's absolutely everything I had hoped.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="quote">We were filled with admiration for your skill in drawing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="quote">Just wanted to say Daniel's picture is wonderful.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="quote">What a splendid occasion yesterday! Thank you very much for 'painting' me - I thoroughly enjoyed our collaboration. The finished portrait was exactly as I would wish to be remembered. Certainly my family and colleagues enjoyed the unveiling as much as I did. Very best wishes.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="quote">Wow - looks really impressive! Thanks so much, as ever.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="quote">My mother described herself as 'absolutely delighted' with the portrait, which for her is extremely effusive - I fear I may have set a birthday present standard which I will be unable to match in future!

Thanks a lot!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="quote">We are absolutely delighted with the picture and look forward to many years of appreciation.
